# Dijkstra-s-Alg - Build.For.Fun


# This program will be able to do 3 things:
  1.Add new vertex/vertices.                                                                                                               
  2.Add new edge(s).                                                                                                                       
  3.Run Dijkstra Algorithm from the selected source to selected destination. SFML installation is required for this project.
